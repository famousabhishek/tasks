  <p>Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.</p>

Biography: Kakashi graduated from the Ninja Academy and became a Genin, when he was merely 5 years old, then at 6 years old, became a Chuunin. He later became a Jounin and a member of the AnBu Assasination squad for Hidden Leaf Village. We see him as he takes up the role as being a sensei for the new Chunnins. Kakashi values team work very much and believes in a battle, your first responbility is to guarantee the safety of your companions. Oh, and he has a Sharingan eye which can copy any ninja skills he sees, but since the Sharingan pupil are usually in both eyes, it's rumoured that Kakashi's sharingan was put into him through surgery.</p>
